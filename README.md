Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Iâ€™m Shristi Ghimire, a software engineer, leader, and mentor with a strong focus on technology, community, and cultural awareness.

ðŸ”­ What Iâ€™m working on:
Leading the development of a language translator app that incorporates cultural context and leverages RAG for accurate translations.
Exploring the integration of cloud computing and machine learning to enhance language processing systems and real-time data applications.
ðŸŒ± My expertise:
Natural Language Processing (NLP) for context-driven translation.
Cloud technologies and Infrastructure as Code (IaC).
Machine learning and predictive analytics.
ðŸ‘¯ Leadership & Community:
SGA Senator at Marymount University, working on the Budget & Operations Committee.
Marketing Chair for both the Asian Student Association and Phi Theta Kappa.
Wellness Ambassador, promoting a healthy and supportive campus environment.
Project Lead and Community Lead for AI and tech-related initiatives.
Mentor at Pineapple Women, supporting the growth of women in tech.
ðŸ’¬ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on:
AI-driven language apps and projects with a focus on cultural sensitivity and contextual understanding.

âš¡ Fun fact:
I can write poems, but if I donâ€™t record them immediately, I forget the tune I was writing them to, making reciting them later super hard!
