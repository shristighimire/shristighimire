Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to my GitHub profile! Hereâ€™s a bit about me:

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a language translator app that incorporates cultural nuances, building the entire system myself by coding every part of speech and using RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to load context from books and dictionaries for more accurate and culturally relevant translations.
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about machine learning and cloud deployment to integrate real-time data streams and predictive analytics into my projects.
ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on IoT, smart city, and data science projects, specifically those focused on real-time data and smart city management.
ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with optimizing real-time data processing, deploying applications on the cloud, and integrating live data sources into dashboards.
ðŸ’¬ Ask me about smart cities, machine learning, or web development.
